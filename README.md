This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a potential numeric overflow error. The program initializes a numeric variable to its maximum value and attempts to increment it.  The solution demonstrates how to handle this by using a larger data type or implementing checks to prevent overflow. This example highlights the importance of careful data type selection and error handling in COBOL applications.
